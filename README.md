AndroipApps
===========

This are two Android Application I partially developed. 

For the first one - Mine Sweeper I developed a data model for  Mine Sweeper game that runs as Android application. It was good exercise in developing a very important software architectural pattern called Model View Control (MVC).

The second one - I developed a graphical interface and data model for very simple Maze Solver. It was an excellent practice in developing GUI interface and applying a data structures (stacks specifically speaking) to make a very simple game running. 

For both I provide a jar file with the full project that should be runnable with the installed Android Emulator.
